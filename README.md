# STEAM-Teachers-Of-Silicon-Valley
STEAM Teachers sharing Curriculum, lessons, Labs, Lectures, Slide... "Fire Breathing Robots" 24/7
---
Teachers... especially the STEAM teachers in the Silicon Valley area... but really anywhere... I'm starting a loose group of teachers who can collaborate on STEAM curriculum. 

Let me know if you would like to join this project. As I teach Highschool, that is where my focus will be, but really Middle school teachers are welcome too. Industry Partners are welcome too, but we will give you homework, so be ready. 

I'm a huge supporter of Open Source, Creative Commons. I think that education should be free, and students should never find themselves on the wrong side of a paywall. I get that Education curriculum takes 100's of hours to even create a few lessons, lectures, labs and assignment, but I really want to empower other teachers to be the best they can be.

As any teacher knows, building a new program with all new, nonexistent content is a daunting but rewarding task. I want this group to make that transition easer, for not only to share material between us, but teachers everywhere.

Here is my philosophy on sharing curriculum: Coming from the Tech industry, where Intellectual property is currency, where most companies tend to not share their technology or work, I have had some growing pains. My first year of teaching, when I taught a Cyber Security class, I felt like all my lesson plans and collateral that I had created had value… and it did... I spent a lot of time one it...

I came to realize that I’m really not competing with other teachers. I work in San Jose, and maybe I have some local competition, but in reality, if a student is not coming to my class or my school, then I’m really not competing with that other teachers in any way… and if you are a teacher who works more than a District away, then we really are not competitors. Let's Share... Collaborate... Help each other...

I have come to the opinion, that while I may have sweat blood and tears developing a lesson plan, it is more value to teachers & students, if it’s shared in an Open Source and creative commons licensed way…

So… That is my plan with this group. We are going to share virtually everything we develop. I know that there is lots of folks who think that they should get some value for the material they develop, and that is fine. I don’t begrudge them that. If they can make that work, great. I’m just saying that is not what this group is going to do.

Topics I would love to collaborate with you all on:
1) Arduino and C++ based labs
2) Robot Arms (both Arduino and Raspberry Pi based
3) Semi conductor topics, like how chips are made, chip design, like Verilog 2 GDSII, even have a path where high school students can have their own chip made (think TinyTapeOut)
4) Python based labs, especially looking at Machine Vision / Robotics
5) Rovers - Python, machine vision, ROS, PiTorch, Autonomous driving...

So… how about it… want to join this STEAM Teachers group?
